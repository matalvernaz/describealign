# describealign
Combines videos with matching audio files (e.g. audio descriptions). Works by aligning parts of the audio file to matching parts of the video's sound.


## Quickstart

Create a copy of a video file with the sound replaced by an audio description:

<img src="https://github.com/matalvernaz/describealign/blob/main/readme_media/describealign_gui_main.PNG" alt="GUI main" align="middle" width="50%"/>

Select a video file and a corresponding audio description using the file browsers, then click "Combine":

<img src="https://github.com/matalvernaz/describealign/blob/main/readme_media/describealign_gui_combiner.PNG" alt="GUI combiner" align="middle" width="50%"/>

The combined media is saved in the folder "videos_with_ad" placed in the home directory. The output directory and other settings can be changed in "Settings":

## Installation

### binary method

Windows, Mac, and Linux users can download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/matalvernaz/describealign/releases/latest), then double click on describealign.exe (Windows) or the describealign executable to open the GUI.

Note for Mac binary users: To open the binary, you'll need to ctrl+click (or right click) on the binary, then click "Open" and then click "Open" again in the window that pops up.

### script method

The python script (describealign.py) can be downloaded and run directly (with Python 3.8+) after installing the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 describealign.py
```


## Testing Installation

The installation can be tested on a clip from the 1929 comedy short [Ask Dad](https://archive.org/details/ask_dad), with the first part of an [audio description](https://archive.org/details/MoviesForTheBlind01-askDad) provided by Valerie H. in her podcast [Movies For the Blind.](https://moviesfortheblind.com/) Download the trimmed versions from the test_media folder in this repository, then select them in the GUI:

<img src="https://github.com/matalvernaz/describealign/blob/main/readme_media/describealign_gui_main_filled.PNG" alt="GUI main filled" align="middle" width="50%"/>

This produces two outputs, a new video file "videos_with_ad/ad_ask_dad_trimmed.mp4" and a plot in alignment_plots:

<img src="https://github.com/matalvernaz/describealign/blob/main/readme_media/ask_dad_trimmed.png" alt="Ask Dad Trimmed Alignment" align="middle" width="50%"/>

The plot shows the audio description starts 202 seconds before the video, which means Valerie starts describing Ask Dad 202 seconds into the podcast. After 40 more seconds, the podcast skips ahead by 3 seconds.

If the full video (22 minutes) and audio description (27 minutes) are used instead, describealign runs in about 30 seconds, using up about 630 MB of RAM, and we get the following plot:

<img src="https://github.com/matalvernaz/describealign/blob/main/readme_media/ask_dad.png" alt="Ask Dad Alignment" align="middle" width="50%"/>

This plot shows a number of small skips starting around 10 minutes in, which add up to a total offset of 30 seconds by the end of the video.

A text version of each plot is saved alongside it:

```


## Advanced Usage

### batching

describealign can be given a directory of videos and a directory of audio files rather than individual files. describealign assumes files from the two directories correspond based on their lexicographic order.

Alternatively, multiple files can be selected simultaneously in the GUI's file selectors. The selected Video and Audio files are first sorted in lexicographic order, then corresponded and aligned.

### drag-and-drop

describealign supports dragging and dropping files or folders onto the video and audio input lists. Files with irrelevant extensions are ignored, while valid files appear in lexicographic order.

### dark mode

describealign opens in either light or dark mode depending on the OS's desktop theme.

### stretch_audio (audio-to-video alignment)

By default describealign stretches video to fit audio descriptions, but the inverse is also possible: stretching the audio description to fit the video with the "--stretch_audio" argument. In both modes, all original audio tracks from the video are preserved in the output alongside the audio description track (which is set as the default).

When using --stretch_audio, the plot also shows which segments of audio were replaced:

<img src="https://github.com/matalvernaz/describealign/blob/main/readme_media/ask_dad_stretch_audio.png" alt="Ask Dad Stretch Audio Alignment" align="middle" width="50%"/>

The original audio is used for segments that would be too noticeably distorted (i.e. more than 10% stretched).

### dry run

Running with `--dry-run` performs the full alignment and saves the alignment plot, but skips writing the output media file. Useful for quickly checking alignment quality before committing to a slow stretch operation:
```bash
describealign video.mp4 audio_desc.mp3 --dry-run
```

### watch mode

Running with `--watch` monitors the input directories and automatically processes new file pairs as they appear. Useful for automated pipelines (e.g. processing audio descriptions as they are downloaded):
```bash
describealign /videos /audio_descriptions --watch
describealign /videos /audio_descriptions --watch --watch-interval 60
```

The `--watch-interval` option controls how often the directories are scanned in seconds (default: 30). Already-processed files are skipped on each scan. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

### audio-to-audio

Whereas describealign is designed to align video-to-audio, it can also align an audio file to another audio file.

### command line interface

describealign can be run without the GUI by specifying input media as positional arguments:
```bash
describealign video.mp4 audio_desc.mp3
```

Note for Mac binary users: The executable is inside the .app and can be run from Terminal with:
```
describealign.app/Contents/MacOS/describealign video.mp4 audio_desc.mp3
```

### module

describealign can also be used as a python module:
```python
import describealign as da
da.combine("ask_dad_trimmed.mp4", "ask_dad_moviesfortheblind_ep_01_trimmed.mp3")
```


## Interesting Use Cases

### dub alignment

describealign is robust enough to align media with completely different dialogue, meaning it can align audio dubbed in a different language to the original video.

### lossless video editing

With default settings (i.e. --stretch_audio set to False), describealign doesn't re-encode either the video or audio streams. It aligns them by modifying the timestamps that video frames are shown at, which means no loss in quality. Basic video editing can be done by deleting or stretching segments of a video's sound in Audacity, then running describealign on the original video and the modified audio.
